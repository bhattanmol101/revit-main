        &quot;Dispute&quot; and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either
        you or us (individually, a “Party” and collectively, the “Parties”), the
        Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those
        Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least ten (10) days
        before initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon
        written notice from one Party to the other Party. Binding Arbitration
        Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this contract,
        including any question regarding its existence, validity, or
        termination, shall be referred to and finally resolved by the
        International Commercial Arbitration Court under the European
        Arbitration Chamber (Belgium, Brussels, Avenue Louise, 146) according to
        the Rules of this ICAC, which, as a result of referring to it, is
        considered as the part of this clause. The number of arbitrators shall
        be three (3). The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be
        BENGALURU, India. The language of the proceedings shall be English. The
        governing law of the contract shall be the substantive law of India.

        the Dispute between the Parties individually. To the full extent
        permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other
        proceeding; (b) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
        arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
        procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be
        brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general
        public or any other persons. Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and
        Arbitration The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not
        subject to the above provisions concerning informal negotiations and
        binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or
        concerning the validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a
        Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising from, allegations of
        theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any
        claim for injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or

        unenforceable and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent
        jurisdiction within the courts listed for jurisdiction above, and the
